# 💧 Water Consumption EDA 📊

This is a beginner exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that analyzes the relationship between **water consumption** and **system breakdowns** in three Algerian cities: **Algiers, Oran, and Setif**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

I created a simple dataset manually and used Python to explore how increasing water usage might be related to infrastructure breakdowns.

- 📄 Type: Mini EDA project
- 👩‍💻 Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- 🧪 Platform: Google Colab
- 📍 Country context: Algeria 🇩🇿

## 🔍 What I Learned

- Creating a custom dataset using dictionaries
- Building and manipulating a DataFrame using pandas
- Visualizing relationships with scatter plots
- Analyzing patterns and drawing data-based conclusions
- Uploading a project to GitHub from Colab!
